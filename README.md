## Key Configuration Steps
### VLAN Configuration
- VLANs were created and verified using the `show vlan` command.

### Switch Configuration
- Configured switches and multilayer switches for VLANs.

### Router Configuration
- Routers were set up to interconnect VLANs and enable inter-VLAN routing.

### Device IP Configuration
- PCs, printers, and wireless routers were configured with specific IPs based on the subnet design.

### Access Restrictions
- Printer access was restricted to specific blocks (e.g., IT Center Block).

## Network Diagrams
The network diagrams visually represent the system's architecture, including the IT Center block, department block, and overall network.

## Usage
This repository is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating how to design and implement a network for a campus environment with VLAN segmentation and proper subnet allocation.
